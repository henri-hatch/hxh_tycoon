# Configure your own "nen ability" which is pretty much just the title + brief description and stats
# Train different stats to grow stronger
# Train the different nen trainings (such as Gyo) by increasing stats
# Do combat to train stats by comparing randomly generated stats based on a level
# Fulfill quests and unlock gear to enhance stats even more with an inventory to go with
